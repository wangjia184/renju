# `bundled` causes us to automatically compile and link in an up to date
# version of SQLite for you. This avoids many common build issues, and
# avoids depending on the version of SQLite on the users system (or your
# system), which may be old or missing. It's the right choice for most
# programs that control their own SQLite databases.
#
# That said, it's not ideal for all scenarios and in particular, generic
# libraries built around `rusqlite` should probably not enable it, which
# is why it is not a default feature -- it could become hard to disable.
